## 🚀 About Me

I'm a seasoned software engineer with 15+ years of experience building and scaling production systems. Currently at Adevinta (Kleinanzeigen), I design and maintain high-throughput backend systems serving **10,000+ requests per second** while championing modern engineering practices across the organization.

As a **Staff Engineer**, I bridge the gap between deep technical execution and strategic product leadership, working alongside product, UX, business, and engineering teams to deliver robust, scalable solutions.
